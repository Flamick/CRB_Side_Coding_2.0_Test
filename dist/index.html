                        <h3>A website should look good, but it's about more than how it looks</h3>
                        <div class="bottom-line"></div>
                        <p>There's a lot of important things that go into building a good website. There's a lot of thought that goes into making a good website. It's not enough to look good, there has to be a structure to it. It needs to follow design principles to help the user navigate it properly and we're going to share with you a few:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Layout: This is the overall structure of the page. If you have too many things on the screen at once, it's almost like being in a room filled with people, and they're all trying to get your attention at the same time, it makes it hard to focus. You want the user to take in small bits at a time so they can absorb what's in front of them.</li>
                            <li>Hierarchy: This is the practice of making the importance of the item or information clearly distinguishable from one another. This can be done in multiple ways. Size, positioning, and color are just some of the things utilized to make the page easier to navigate. This ties into the layout with the goal of making the information easier to take in for the user.</li>
                            <li>Contrast: Most of us have heard about contrast, but not all of us know how it affects the user of a website. Think of winter when the snow is covering the ground, when you look around it's hard to distinguish between different things in your surroundings. This is because there is less contrast and the same idea applies to a website. Without good contrast, it gets difficult to tell things apart.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are only a few important principles of web design. At the end of the day, the goal behind web design is to make the experience of the user as smooth and easy to use as possible. Yes, it is important to be visually pleasing to the eye, but it's also very important to design your page in such a way that the user has an easy time navigating through all of the information.</p>

                        <p>Creating a website can be confusing. You may be unsure if you should make a website yourself or if you should hire someone to do it for you. With CRB Side Coding LLC, you will see the dedication and passion to succeed that drives our business, just as your dedication and passion drives yours, and the benefits include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>A process that ensures that you don't have to do any more work than you need to because we understand that your time is important to you just as ours is to us.</li>
                        <li>Step by step communication along the process to ensure the project follows not only our framework for success but your vision as well.</li>
                        <li>The framework of your websites design isn't just based on the principles of design, but also the psychology behind what drives a potential customer to say yes to your product/service.</li>
                        <li>Helping your business show up on local Google searches for customers in your area looking for your service. With a website, you have a better chance of getting new, organic customers than without.</li>
                        <li>After the project is complete, it doesn't end there. We analyze the data of the website for 3 months following the launch of your website (at no extra cost to you) and provide you with a revision based on that information to not only provide a stronger online presence at launch but a long term tool to bring in more revenue.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you are still unsure and are building a website on your own, planning on building one yourself, or already have one, we will give you a free consultation on what you can do to improve your website and get you the results you are looking for.</p>
